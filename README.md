# smu_password_gen
So my first thought is to get the prompts working. So my point of attack is going to involve establishing variables to store the user's choices in regards to their password requirements. Then I need to make the app able to use this information in a useful way.

Alright, first hurdle is over. I have the website prompting the user for their password requirements and then storing that information to be used. I have a few ideas as to how I might make the prompts more resiliant to poor options but I'm going to focus on random generation of a password without parameters first.
